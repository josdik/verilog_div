# WARNING THIS IS A TERRIBLE DIVIDER

This divider is based on [the following link](https://projectf.io/posts/division-in-verilog/). This project is just to give it a personal take on the algorithm shown there.

Basically this project tries to use the 
* next state update
* next state logic
* datapath logic

workflow, or in other words, how i understand digital design.

Kinda bad since its pretty long and the number of cycles can be improved. However, overall the algorithm is solid and works OKAY i guess.
